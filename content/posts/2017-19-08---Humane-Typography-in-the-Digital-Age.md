## My "Index Card" Review

_Childhood's End_ is a book about human civilization's evolution. Alien overlords fix our problems allowing humanity to evolve further, but humanity loses its sense of finding meaning and value. This book touches on themes of Religion and Purpose, just as much as it touches on the problems of Utopian societies.

## A quote I loved

<figure>
	<blockquote>
		<p>â€œNo utopia can ever give satisfaction to everyone, all the time. As their material conditions improve, men raise their sights and become discontented with power and possessions that once would have seemed beyond their wildest dreams...."</p>

## A Word I Learned

### _Syllogism_
an instance of a form of reasoning in which a conclusion is drawn (whether validly or not) from two given or assumed propositions (premises), each of which shares a term with the conclusion, and shares a common or middle term not present in the conclusion (e.g., all dogs are animals; all animals have four legs; therefore all dogs have four legs ).


## On Book Reviews

Writing book reviews is something new I am trying. I don't particularly see the value in writing _another_ review. Instead I will keep my reviews "Index Card" at length, and focus on high level things I've learned and felt.


## Published on Medium

Along with on my personal website, I publish on Medium as well. Here's the review there.
